Rule1: If there is any abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.

Rule2: If you are extending any abstract class that have abstract method, you 
      must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.

#Asbstract class in JAva:
	A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract class in java.
	It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with body).
	Before learning java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in java first.
	  
#Abstraction in Java
	Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
	Another way, it shows only important things to the user and hides the internal details for example sending
	sms, you just type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message
	delivery.
	Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
	
#Ways to achieve Abstraction
	There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java:
		1.Abstract class (0 to 100%)
		2.Interface (100%)
